# Developer Challenge Submission: To-Do App

This is a complete, full-stack application built for the developer challenge. It features a polished Flutter mobile app for users and a professional Next.js admin panel, all powered by a Firebase backend.

* **Custom App Icon & Theming:** The app has a unique launcher icon and a consistent, modern color scheme and font.
* **Intuitive UX:** Includes "Swipe to Delete," success feedback messages, and a helpful hint for new features.
* **New User Onboarding:** A multi-step carousel dialog welcomes new users and explains key features.
